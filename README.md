# SpotifyEmotion

Angular 2 web application that uses [Microsoft's Cognitive Services API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/?v=17.25b) to detect the most prevalent emotion from the facial expression of an individual in an image uploaded by the user. Then, using [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), suggests a Spotify playlist of tracks that evoke the detected emotion.

Created as a fun way to learn Angular 2 and the [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) library.
